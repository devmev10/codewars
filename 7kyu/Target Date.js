// You have an amount of money a0 > 0 and you deposit it with an interest rate of p percent divided by 360 per day on the 1st of January 2016. You want to have an amount a >= a0.

// Task:
// The function date_nb_days (or dateNbDays...) with parameters a0, a, p will return, as a string, the date on which you have just reached a.

// Example:
// date_nb_days(100, 101, 0.98) --> "2017-01-01" (366 days)

// date_nb_days(100, 150, 2.00) --> "2035-12-26" (7299 days)

// Notes:
// The return format of the date is "YYYY-MM-DD"
// The deposit is always on the "2016-01-01"
// Don't forget to take the rate for a day to be p divided by 36000 since banks consider that there are 360 days in a year.
// You have: a0 > 0, p% > 0, a >= a0

// My Solution
function dateNbDays(a0, a, p) {
  const interestPerDay = p / 36000; // Calculate the interest rate per day

  let currentDate = new Date("2016-01-01");
  let currentAmount = a0;

  while (currentAmount < a) {
    const interest = currentAmount * interestPerDay;
    currentAmount += interest;
    currentDate.setDate(currentDate.getDate() + 1);
  }

  const year = currentDate.getFullYear();
  const month = String(currentDate.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0");
  const day = String(currentDate.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");

  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`;
}
